<h2 id="project-name">About Me (Part 3)</h2>

<p>Create a website which lists some about me information, and has a y/n quiz about me on it. The project must at least meet these requirements from the first lab:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript must be cleanly written with correct indentation and syntax. Look at examples online and in your textbook. Note that your JS must pass the rules in the linter that we installed.</li>
  <li>Your JS file must contain a ‘use strict’ declaration at the top. Always.</li>
  <li>Design a guessing game about you that involves FIVE yes/no questions. Be creative and fun and whimsical. Or not. It’s up to you! It’s your project!</li>
  <li>The questions in the guessing game must require a mix of yes/no answers, and user input must accept either y/n or yes/no responses, with either .toUpperCase() or .toLowerCase() used to validate the user input and accommodate users entering all-caps Y/N or YES/NO answers, too.</li>
  <li>Useful and descriptive console.log() messages in the JS are well written and correctly displaying to the browser console for each question of the guessing game.</li>
  <li>Use CSS to style your page as you see fit, to the level of abilities in CSS that you currently have.</li>
  <li>Follow the Add, Commit, Push process. It should be evident in GitHub that commits are made regularly, and with good commit messages that explain the WHY of the commit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Along with these new requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Per the user stories, you will need to include in your HTML at least one each of an ordered and an unordered list.</li>
  <li>Use promptfor input and alert for output to the user, unless you are working on the third Stretch Goal.</li>
  <li>Do not write any functions in your JavaScript.</li>
  <li>Expect that you will probably need both ‘for’ and ‘while’ structures for your sixth and seventh questions. But not necessarily.</li>
  <li>As a developer, I want to make my code more DRY by putting all of the questions, answers, and responses to the first five yes/no questions in my guessing game into arrays (or even one huge multidimensional array), and modifying the game logic such that a ‘for’ loop will control the flow from question to question.</li>
  <li>Make the number-guessing question use a random number as its correct answer.</li>
  <li>Audit your page’s accessibility. If you’ve already done this, audit your updated code, and work to improve your score. Test your HTML/CSS for accessibility with Chrome’s built-in Accessibility Auditing tool. Note that you’ll have to deploy your site somehow, and make some changes to your code to get the auditing tools to see your HTML code. You can disable the other audit checks when you run your audit. Include an image of your accessability report score in your submission’s README.md file.</li>
</ul>

<p> Then after all of that, I gave the code to Calvin, the driver, who put everything in functions for lab 4.</p>
